Hangman in OuterSpace!:
OVERVIEW
- We are exploring our solarsystem and have ventured too close to the sun! The only way to tap in to our back-up power source is to enter in a special code! Get the code right before we all get fried!

OPERATIONS
- Type any get to generate the engine-code, which will appear underneath the window looking towards the sun. Geuss the engine code by typing in letter one at a time. If the letter guessed is included in the code-word, it will appear. Letters already guessed will be displayed in the screen next to the window facing the sun. The number of attempts-left underneath the code word. Guess the code within 10 attempts or we will be toast. If you do guess the code within 10 attempts, you win! We can live another day! The number of wins will be displayed on the top underneath the title of the game.
